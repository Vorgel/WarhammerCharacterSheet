# WarhammerCharacterSheet

So this project is a Web application created in Angular to manage Warhammer Character Sheet. 

It's connected to another project - CharacterSheetAPI (backend created in .NET using MVC API).

Currently in progress, i promise i will commit once in a while if anyone cares.

My biggest project so far i think.
